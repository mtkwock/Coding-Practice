/* TODO
Implement a stack with push and pop functions
Implement a queue with queue and dequeue functions
Find the minimum element in a stack in O(1) time
Write a function that sorts a stack (bonus: sort the stack in place without extra memory)
Implement a binary min heap. Turn it into a binary max heap
HARD: Implement a queue using 2 stacks
