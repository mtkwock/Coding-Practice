/* TODO
Implement a BST with insert and delete functions
Print a tree using BFS and DFS
Write a function that determines if a tree is a BST
Find the smallest element in a BST
Find the 2nd largest number in a BST
Given a binary tree which is a sum tree (child nodes add to parent), write an algorithm to determine whether the tree is a valid sum tree
Find the distance between 2 nodes in a BST and a normal binary tree
Print the coordinates of every node in a binary tree, where root is 0,0
Print a tree by levels
Given a binary tree which is a sum tree, write an algorithm to determine whether the tree is a valid sum tree
Given a tree, verify that it contains a subtree.
HARD: Find the max distance between 2 nodes in a BST.
HARD: Construct a BST given the pre-order and in-order traversal Strings
